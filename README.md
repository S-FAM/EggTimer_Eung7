### Open Libraries
> PanModal
> 
> SnapKit

### Notes
> + I implemented application by only code. 
> + MVVM Architecture is combined in this application. This Application has no programmatic logic with network but I think it was still worth it. cause understanding moving data from view to another view and completely dividing between view and model is the step which means can handle more complicated data structure and applications.

## MainView

+ You will see your list having timer and food name.
+ You will play timer from selected item in your list.
+ You will remove specific item when trash button tapped.
